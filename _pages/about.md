<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am <font size="5"><b>Peng-Hao Hsu</b></font>, a visiting student at [UC Mercedâ€™s Vision and Learning Lab (VLLab)](http://vllab.ucmerced.edu/), where I have the privilege of working with [Prof. Ming-Hsuan Yang](http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/mhyang). My research focuses on 3D computer vision and multimodal learning, areas that ignite my passion for exploring the intersection of technology and perception.

I hold an M.S. degree from the College of Semiconductor Research at [National Tsing Hua University]((https://nthu-en.site.nthu.edu.tw)), and a B.S. degree in Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management from the same institution. During my time at NTHU, I was a member of the (Vision Science Lab)[https://aliensunmin.github.io/lab/info.html], where I conducted research in 3D computer vision under the guidance of (Prof. Min-Sun)[https://aliensunmin.github.io].
